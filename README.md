# kind-portal

This library adapts the [Portal](https://github.com/djblue/portal/) tool to support the [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly/) convention for Clojure literate programming.

It is part of an ongoing attemt to create a common ground for Clojure learning resources that would work across different tools.
